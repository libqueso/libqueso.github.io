{"name":"QUESO","tagline":"A C++ library for the Quantification of Uncertainty for Estimation, Simulation and Optimization","body":"##The QUESO library\r\n\r\n`QUESO` stands for Quantification of Uncertainty for Estimation, Simulation and Optimization.\r\n\r\n`QUESO` is a collection of algorithms for solving statistical inverse problems with quantified uncertainties, and is designed for flexibility, portability, usability and extensibility.  Its software design follows an object-oriented approach and its code is written in C++ over `MPI`, enabling the use of multiprocessor environments.\r\n\r\n###Installation\r\n\r\nYou can obtain `QUESO` tarballs [here](https://github.com/libqueso/queso/releases).\r\n\r\nIf you do not have a `configure` script in the top level directory, run `./bootstrap` to generate a configure script using `autotools`.  After this is done, `QUESO` may be installed in the 'usual' fashion as shown here:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./configure\r\n$ make -j8  # Pass -j8 to use 8 processors to build queso\r\n$ make install\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditional options may be provided to the `configure` script if desired; run `./configure --help` for details.\r\n\r\n###Documentation\r\n\r\n`QUESO` documentation is available [here](http://libqueso.github.io/queso/docs/html/).\r\n\r\n###Dependencies\r\n\r\nAt a minimum, `QUESO` compilation requires `MPI` and linkage against two external libraries:\r\n\r\n- [Boost](http://www.boost.org/)\r\n- [GSL](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)\r\n\r\n`QUESO` also has several optional dependencies that enable additional functionality:\r\n\r\n- [Teuchos](http://trilinos.sandia.gov/packages/docs/r7.0/packages/teuchos/doc/html/index.html)\r\n- [GRVY](https://red.ices.utexas.edu/projects/hpct/files)\r\n- [HDF5](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/)\r\n- [GLPK](https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/)\r\n- [PETSc](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/)\r\n\r\nShould you be interested in using the optional infinite dimensional capabilities of `QUESO`, then you also need the following dependencies:\r\n\r\n- [libMesh](http://libmesh.sourceforge.net) compiled with [SLEPc](http://www.grycap.upv.es/slepc/)\r\n- [HDF5](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/)\r\n\r\n###License\r\n\r\nSee [`LICENSE`](https://github.com/libqueso/queso/blob/dev/LICENSE) file distributed with `QUESO` for more information.\r\n\r\n###Contributing\r\n\r\nContributions are very welcome.  If you wish to contribute, please take a few moments to review the [branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) `QUESO` utilizes.\r\n\r\n###Support\r\n\r\nIf you have questions or need help with using or contributing to `QUESO`, feel free to ask questions on one of the mailing lists:\r\n\r\n- [queso-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/queso-users) mailing\r\n  list for questions regarding usage and reporting bugs\r\n- [queso-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/queso-dev) mailing list\r\n  for discussion regarding development of `QUESO`\r\n\r\n###Citing QUESO\r\n\r\nPlease add the following citation to any paper, technical report or\r\narticle describing the use of the `QUESO` library:\r\n\r\n```bibtex\r\n@inproceedings{Prudencio2012,\r\n  author = {Prudencio, Ernesto E and Schulz, Karl W},\r\n  booktitle = {Euro-Par 2011: Parallel Processing Workshops},\r\n  pages = {398--407},\r\n  publisher = {Springer},\r\n  title = {{The parallel C++ statistical library ‘QUESO’: Quantification of\r\n    Uncertainty for Estimation, Simulation and Optimization}},\r\n  url = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-29737-3\\_44},\r\n  year = {2012}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
